What is Heavycoin?
----------------

Heavycoin is an Ultra-secure, Democratic and CPU-only Crypto-currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Heavycoin client sofware, see http://heavycoin.github.io.

Innovations and contributions
-------

* HEFTY1 - a cryptographic hash function for CPU-only proof-of-work with a small memory footprint
* Ultra-secure hashing - a secure strategy for using multiple cryptographic hash functions
* Temporal Retargeting - multipool protection that goes beyond Kimoto Gravity Well
* Decentralized Block Reward Voting - the mining schedule and money supply are democratically decided (total supply is still bounded to 128M)

Goals
-------------------

* Achieve massive adoption as a major crypto-currency
* Provide long-term open source development, support and maintenance
* Promote a large-scale decentralized CPU-only mining community
* Build a gigantic community of stakeholders from a diverse set backgrounds
* Promote the use of democratic processes in peer-to-peer systems using decentralized block reward voting

Specifications
-------

* CPU-only: Introduces HEFTY1, a novel approach to CPU-only proof-of-work
* Ultra-secure: combines SHA-256, Keccak-512, Gr√∏estl-512, BLAKE-512 in a secure way
* Block time: 2 Min
* Retarget up: Every 5 blocks (max 100%)
* Retarget down: Every block (max 400%)
* Starting block reward: 0 (for first 100 blocks ~ 3.3 hours)
* Block reward: 1024 max (decentralized block reward voting)
* Total supply: 63M to 128M HVC (depending on decentralized block reward voting)
* Multipool protection: Kimoto Gravity Well Temporal Retargeting
* Premine: 1-2% (depending on total supply) for future development, support and maintenance
* Bounties: 1-2% (depending on total supply) for strategic direction and promoting of heavycoin
* IPO: 4-8% (depending on total supply) already distributed over 172 stakeholders
